# Steps for a more realistic result

**This macro has the principle WYSIWYG, so the rendering is often not very realistic. For more a more realistic rendering result you need to edit the inc file.**

### Things to change
* Area Light
* Raytracing
* Better Background / Sky
* Very little normal to every object (in the reality, no object is perfect)
* Link to change the material of objects (maybe define a standard finish)

If you have not so much konwledge about POVray, we created a few templates for you. You can find them in the [template folder](../Examples/Templates/).
