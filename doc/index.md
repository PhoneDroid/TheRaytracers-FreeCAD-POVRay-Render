# Export to POVray - Documentation
#### The macro that creates user friendly .pov files from CSG objects

This macro is intended to export CSG objects from the Part Workbench to a good readable and editable POVray file. For that, the macro converts the FreeCAD tree view into the POVray language.
The user can edit the file, so that he can use the full options of POVray to make da photorealistic picture of his model. An important principle is WYSIWYG (**W**hat **Y**ou **S**ee **I**s **W**hat **Y**ou **G**et). The rendered picture should be like the view in FreeCAD but with a photorealistic display.
