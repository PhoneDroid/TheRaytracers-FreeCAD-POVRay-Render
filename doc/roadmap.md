# Roadmap

A software is never finished. We have three big things for the future, we want to develop:

* support more objects
  * support PartDesign workbench (in progress)
* add a texture tab to the dialog, where you can define textures for each object
* develop a workbench with all these features and where you can define directly cameras, light sources, backgrounds and so on
