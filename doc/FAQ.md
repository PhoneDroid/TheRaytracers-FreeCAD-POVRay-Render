# FAQ

* **I get no image, only the pov file**  
  * See instructions in [Quickstart](quickstart.md)
  * Are you sure, that you installed POV-Ray?
  * Does the path to the executable exsist in the settings of the raytracing workbench?
  * Maybe there is an error in your inc file. You will get a error window and a err file can be found in the directory of the .pov file.
  * If there is a mistake in the pov file, then the macro has a bug. Please report the bug (see below), so that other users won't have this problem.


* **Which objects are supported?**  
  We created a page with all supported objects and the objects we support hopefully soon: [Supported Features](supported.md)


* **The rendered image doesn't look realistic, but plastic**  
  Look here for tips to [Get a more realistic rendering](realistic.md).


* **I found a bug in the macro**  
  Please report the bug to us, so we hopefully can fix it soon.

* **I want to contribute to the macro**  
  Cool, a software is never finished :-)  
  Please read our [Developer Documentation](developer.md) and start coding!  
  Or report a bug (see above), this is also contributing and not less important than coding! Without bug reporting the problem won't be solved and every user will have it!
