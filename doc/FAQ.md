# FAQ

* **I get no image, only the pov file**  
  * Are you sure, that you installed POV-Ray? If you installed POV-Ray and you get no image, please report a bug (see below).
  * Or maybe there is an error in your inc file. Please start POV-Ray externally with the pov file and look at the error message. If there is a mistake in the pov file, then the macro has a bug. Please report the bug (see below), that other user won't have this problem.

* **The rendered image doesn't look realistic, it looks very plastic**  
  Look here for tips to [get a more realistic rendering](realistic.md).

* **I found a bug in the macro**  
  Please report the bug to us, so we can fix it hopefully soon.  
  You can report the bug via

* **I want to contribute to the macro**  
  Cool, a software is never finished :-)  
  Please read our [Developer Documentation](developer.md) and start coding!  
  Or report a bug (see above), that is also contributing and not less important than coding! Without bug reporting the problem would be there forever and every user would have the problem!
